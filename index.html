				<p class="editable">Living systems are characterized by the emergence of recurrent dynamical patterns at all scales of magnitude. Self-organized behaviors are observed both in large communities of microscopic components - like neural oscillations and gene network activity - as well as on larger levels - as predator-prey equilibria to name a few. Such regularities are deemed to be universal in the sense they are due to common mechanisms, independent of the details of the system. This belief justifies investigation through quantitative models able to grasp key features while disregarding inessential complications. The attempt of modeling such complex systems leads naturally to consider large families of microscopic identical units. Complexity and self-organization then arise on a macroscopic scale from the dynamics of these minimal components that evolve coupled by interaction terms. Within this scenario, probability theory and statistical mechanics come into play very soon.<br>
				The aim of this conference is to bring together scientists with different backgrounds (maths, biology, physics and computing, theoreticians along with experimentalists), interested in macroecology, microbial ecology and evolutionary biology, to discuss important and recent research topics in these areas as well as exchange methods and ideas. The style of the conference will purposely be informal so as to encourage discussions.</p>

				<p class="editable">In recent years, a fast development of different quantum hardware, theoretical models and numerical tools has been achieved, which pave the way to unprecedented investigations in quantum science, and in particular in the study of out of equilibrium many-body processes. However, the new challenges call for different expertise that has to be merged: from the theoretical and experimental or numerical knowledge to the theoretical understanding of the system to be simulated. It is then important that experts from different perspectives talk together, exchange ideas providing open problems to be attacked and new ideas for possible platforms where questions can be answered.  Following the success of the first three editions, the fourth edition of this conference aims to consolidate a new community of actors working together in this exciting interdisciplinary field.</p>
